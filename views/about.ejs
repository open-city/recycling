      <h2>What is this site for and who made it?</h2>
      <p><em>My Building Doesnâ€™t Recycle!</em> is a web app that allows multi-unit renters (renters in buildings with 5 or more units) to report that they do not have recycling in their building. This site was created by <a href='http://clairemicklin.com' target='_blank'>Claire Micklin</a>, <a href='http://benwilhelm.com' target='_blank'>Ben Wilhelm</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/alexkahn' target='_blank'>Alex Kahn</a> at <a href='https://chihacknight.org/' target='_blank'>Open Government Hack Night</a>.</p>

      <h2>Why do we need this site?</h2>
      <p>In 1994, the city of Chicago passed the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Illinois/chicago_il/title11utilitiesandenvironmentalprotecti/chapter11-5reductionandrecyclingprogram?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:chicago_il$anc=JD_11-5-021'>Chicago High Density Residential and Commercial Source Reduction and Recycling Ordinance</a>, commonly known as the Burke-Hansen ordinance, that stated that multi-unit/high-density residents must have adequate access to refuse and recycling disposal. With the completion rollout of the city of Chicago&#039;s Blue Cart program in early 2014, people who live in single-family homes and apartment buildings with 4 or fewer units now do have access to recycling services. Yet, there is still no equivalent service for multi-unit (5+ unit) buildings.</p>

      <p>In order to provide recycling services to tenants, landlords in multiunit buildings must contract with a private recycling hauler, and it costs extra money on top of the solid waste disposal fees they already pay. Since the multi-unit recycling ordinance is not enforced, most multiunit landlords opt not to provide recycling services to their tenants. And since the city does not enforce the Burke-Hansen law, there is no channel for multi-unit dwellers to report a lack of recycling services in their building. Thus, it is very hard to determine how much recycling <em>isn&#039;t</em> happening.</p>

      <h2>What will you do with the data?</h2>
      <p>The data will help us to visualize reports of recycling noncompliance and provide a hub for residents of multi-unit buildings and other Chicago residents to have a collective voice in favor of more comprehensive recycling services. Our group plans to use the visualizations as a tool for advocacy and to push for the strengthening and enforcement of the Burke-Hansen Ordinance.</p>

      <h2>How can I help?</h2>
