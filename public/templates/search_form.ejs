  <h2 id="searchFormLabel">No recycling in your building?</h2>
  <h3>Report it!</h3>
  <p>Although the Burke-Hansen ordinance requires that buildings with 5 or more units provide recycling services, the city of Chicago chooses not to enforce this law. Thus, many Chicagoans are left with no recycling services.</p>
  <p>By reporting your building, you can help us visualize the scope of this problem in order to mobilize support for a change in city recycling policy.</p>
