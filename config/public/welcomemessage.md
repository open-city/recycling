[Chicago law](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/streets/supp_info/construction_demolitionsites0.html) requires buildings with 5 or more residential units to provide recycling services to occupants.

However, the City of Chicago does not enforce this lawâ€”and this leads many landlords NOT to provide recycling services to tenants.

Add your report to our registry to show that your building does not recycle.

Your report shows that many buildings are NOT offering recycling and that Chicagoans support stronger recycling laws.
